# Visitors Identification
> three different examples:
1. A basic identification (a new visitor is coming to your website and you don’t know him at all)
2. An anonymous identification (a visitor is coming back to the website. You don’t know who he is, but you know what he did before)
3. A nominative identification (a visitor is logged in on your website, so he is known in your user referential)
