# Develop data and Schema Patches

## Flow
1 - you must create a file under:  <Vendor>/<Module_Name>/Setup/Patch/Data/<Patch_Name>.php
 * This file needs to implement:  \Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\SchemaPatchInterface
 * A list of applied patches is stored in the patch_list database table.
 * An unapplied patch will be applied when running the setup:upgrade from the Magento CLI.

* If you want to rollback you must implement: \Magento\Framework\Setup\Patch\PatchRevertableInterface.

```
Note: The declarative schema approach removes the version from the setup_module table leaving only the Composer version
Note2: Therefore, you can create all new patches and modules without specifying a setup_module version.
Note3: Magento prioritizes the declarative schema approach and executes updates from the db_schema.xml before the data and schema patches
```

## How to declare dependencies?
* To define a dependency in a patch, add the method public static function getDependencies() to the patch class and return the class names
 of the patches this patch depends on. The dependency can be in any module.
```
public static function getDependencies()
{
    return [
        \SomeVendor\SomeModule\Setup\Patch\Data\SomePatch::class
    ];
}
```
